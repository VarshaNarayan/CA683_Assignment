# Comparison of Supervised Machine Learning Models for News Category Classification

The ever growing volume of online information has resulted in huge amounts of text data which has given rise to unclassified information. The need for classifying news into categories for users to access the information is also increasing. Politics has always been the hottest and the most sensitive topic worldwide. Although it is the most, or sometimes the only, interesting topic amongst various groups of people, there is a separate set of population who are least interested in politics. This leads to two classes of people; i) Political Enthusiast ii) Political Apatheist. Grouping news into politics and non politics will help users to engage with the topics of their interests effectively and helps social media recommend relevant news. In this paper, we have summarised the performances of various machine learning algorithms to classify news into Politics and Other categories on an imbalanced dataset.
